# Simple Sudoku Web Game

A compact beginner-friendly Sudoku web project built with **HTML + CSS + JavaScript**.
This includes a generator (backtracking), solver (backtracking), and a simple UI.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — basic styling
- `script.js` — game logic (generator, solver, UI)

## Run locally
1. Save files in a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use `Live Server` in VSCode).

## Publish (quick options)
### GitHub Pages (recommended)
1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Commit these files to the `main` branch.
3. Go to `Settings` → `Pages` → select branch `main` → `/ (root)` → Save.
4. Your site will be published at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

### Netlify / Vercel
- Drag-and-drop the project folder into Netlify's dashboard or Vercel's static site import — both support instant publishing.

## Notes
- This project implements uniqueness checks when removing numbers; generating 'hard' puzzles may take longer.
- If you want enhancements (timer, pencil marks, mobile input polish, better accessibility), fork and modify `script.js`.

Have fun building — you can now host this on GitHub Pages or Netlify and share it with others! :)
